# `tufte-style-article` for Internship reports

`tufte-style-article` is a LaTeX class designed by Sylvain Kern to mimic Edward Tufte's works. This repository does not change much: it adds a nice and simple cover page for internship reports.

Be sure to check [the original work](https://github.com/sylvain-kern/tufte-style-article) for informations about installation and usage of the main class.
